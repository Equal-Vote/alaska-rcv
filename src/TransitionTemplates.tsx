                    <p>There are several possible outcomes depending on where the votes land in those ranges, but for a specific example let's see what would happen if we assume each

                        {avgLowScoreIndex == 1 && ` ${election.names.center} and ${election.names.left} `}

                    <p>And then in the runoff round each vote will go to the finalist they most preferred (just like RCV) and then the win would go to {runoffWinner(avgLowScoreIndex)}</p>
                    <p>So RCV and STAR work similarly in that they both narrow the field down to 2 candidates and end in a runoff, but they're very different in how they reduce the candidates.
                        RCV only looks at first choice preferences so it ends up with many of the same problems as Choose-One, whereas STAR uses all the data to select the finalists with the most
