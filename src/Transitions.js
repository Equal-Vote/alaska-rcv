                    caused many RCV repeals including 3 juristictions that experience monotonicity or compromise failures (Burlington, VT; Pierce, WA; and Moab, UT)</p>

                    <li>RCV guarantees a majority winner - FALSE</li>
                    <li>RCV virtually guarantees a condorcet winner - FALSE</li>
                    <li>RCV solves the spoiler effect - FALSE</li>
                    <li>It's safe to rank your first choice - FALSE</li>
