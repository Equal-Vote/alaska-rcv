    // Burlington, Vermont
        // reason: because incumbant won with only 29% of the first place votes?
    // Aspen, Colorado
        // reason: results are same as plurality, but lack of precint summabilility caused delays in the results
    // Pierce County, WA
        // reason: voters opinion shifted massively, presumably because it was complicated to vote in?
    // Ann Arbor Michigan
        // reason: RCV created unity between democrats and 3rd party, so republicans repealed it
    // State of North Carolina
        // reason: repealed via a bill because voters found it difficult?

                        The bug was specifically related to ballots that either skipped their first ranking, or specified a write-in for their ranking.
                        When tallying the top 3 candidates, these votes should have been transferred to their next choice, but they weren't and a disproportionate number of the voters who misfilled their rankings were Hutchinson voters.

            <p>This election was essentially a repeat of the special election 6 months prior, and it was interesting to see how the votes changed</p>
            <p>Voting theorists wondered if the results from the previous election would cause voters to be more strategic in the general, but this wasn't the case</p>
            <p>Instead voters shifted left across the board and Peltola was the true condorcet winner this time</p>
            <p>There are 2 primary explanations for this <ul>
                <li>The general election had much more voters, and voters in general elections tend to be more left leaning</li>
                <li>Sarah Palin had the most name recognition going into the special election, and this likely created an electability bias in her favor.
                    Going into the general Peltola was the incumbant, so this shifted the electability bias to her. This implies that one unrepresentative
                    outcome can create a domino effect and give the that candidate an edge in future elections
