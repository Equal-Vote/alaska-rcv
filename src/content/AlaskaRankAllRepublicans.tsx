            <p>This speaks to one of the positives of RCV in that candidates are encouraged to form coalitions rather than strictly limit themselves to negative campaigning, but is it enough to overcome RCV's fundamental flaws?</p>
            <p>It turns out that "Rank all Republicans" would likely be an effective strategy for electing a Republican, however even with the improved voter education RCV will still fail to select winners that best represent the people.</p>

            <p>Let's reset and look at the other half of the "Rank all Republicans" message. Would a more unifying message be enough to move some of the Republicans who voted Peltola second?</p>
            <p>Perhaps these were votes against Palin rather than specifically for Peltola, and an olive branch from Palin would be enough to swing them.
                Unfortunately the RCV ballot isn't expressive enough for us to guage how strong the Peltola support is
                so it's hard to say how effective this would be
